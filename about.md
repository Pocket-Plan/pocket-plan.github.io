Our daily obligations, commitments and distractions default us into a state of neglect. Faced with the decision between improvement and stagnation, which of the two would one choose? I think most of us would choose stagnation. This is not because we lack skill or the resources to improve, but because comfort has inundated us with a stupor. In professional spheres, negligence is punished with humiliation: stripped of your licence to practise, reputation scorned, and your ability to make a living vanish. 

But as to neglience in our very lives? What is one punished with? I can't answer that with certainty, but it may be a depression in hauora: our physical, mental/emotional, social and spiritual well-being. To combat such a force, I've found a life that exercses [stoicism](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/12/21/call-new-strenuous-age/) to be the most rewarding.

My name is [Cornelius](http://www.github.com/{{site.github_username}}) and I want to learn, grow and challenge myself. I'm always looking for my blindspots so tell me when they show. Pocket Plan is my personal framework for accelerated learning and prototyping.

**The Reader:** Hey... what's this boring default text below doing here?

**Me:** Well, while I'm fleshing out the website, this visual reminder compels me to make improvements in aesthetics. Sorry for looking so generic, but I have long forgotten about HTML and CSS; my previous website [the-waypoint](http://the-waypoint.github.io/) was bespoke.
