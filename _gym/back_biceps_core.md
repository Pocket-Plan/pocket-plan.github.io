Oh my gosh, writing up this routine took forever. I will need to finish writing up '3. Assisted Biceps Curl'. Also the '#' heading markup is all wrong. Why should '#', Heading 1, be smaller than '##' Heading 2??

Sorry this post probably doesn't mean much to most people. It's mean to be a reference for routines at the gym since my personal trainer gives me too many to keep track of in my head.

## 1. Assisted Lat Pulldown Machine

### 1A. Setup: Wide Grip
- Set seat height to 6
- Sit as close as possible and lock yourself in.
- Your hips, shoulders and hands gripping the bars should all be in one vertical line.
- Grip the bars, overhand grip apnd slightly further than shoulder width apart.
- Don't lean back but keep the Terminator posture.

#### Action:
- Pull the bars straight down, only the upper lats should be doing work. (Imagine you are doing a seated pull up)
- Motion should be 2s down, 2s up.
- Keep chin up and lock it, don't pull it down as you are pull the weights
