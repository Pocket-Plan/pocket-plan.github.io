>Wow, I would have tried starting this project back in December 2017? (@ exactly 2017-12-11 19:46:46 +1300) Yikes. Time flies when you don't have a plan, so let's make one:

Did the plan work? Let's review:

>1. Read for 1 hour a day. Spread this out over two 30 minute sessions uninterrupted. Current readings: Finance and Macroeconomics.

 I definitely filled 30 minutes of morning time reading Macroeconomics. A lot of it does seem to fly over my head but the principles stick. I will need to find a way of writing these lessons down. Right now it's on refill paper but the notes are all scattered. As to the second block of 30 minutes, I think it's very casual but once again suffers from being scattered. Maybe the focus should be reading a difficult book in the morning and then reading a pleasant, easy-to-read book in the evenings. This way I am guaranteed to finish two books in due course with the idea sustained throughout instead of being brain-scattered trying to remember 6+ threads of stories or thoughts.

>2. Write essays. Joel Spolsky recommends people to undergo a writing bootcamp that stimulates people to write a 4-5 page essay every week for 10 weeks. 2000 words a week? In this context, sticks and stones may hurt me, but words and strings don't. Common advice is to write what you know about, and, by that inference something you find interesting. This week's topic: One Punch Man.

I'm falling short in this area. Learning to write from John Warriner's Composition and Grammar is taking a bit longer than expected. The lessons here are useful and will enable me to write a persuasive essay but maybe I also need to read the chapter on exposition. The One Punch Man essay will be both expositional and persuasive - what essay isn't?

>3. Paint that damn sign. More on this later.

Yay. The Biology tutor sign is being painted. I'm a mercernary for hire. I can't tell if people require tutoring in this area but you won't know unless you test the waters. It's a good exercise anyhow, it keeps the hands and body busy; my only gripe is that it's not a very active and I'm still hunching over something. But all that aside, painting in Acrylic is super fun, the first few strokes were terrible and it shows if you read the sign closely. The latter strokes, with more guidance, patience and technique look wonderful.

>4. Maintain Order: "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time." Turn off all electronic devices one hour before sleeping to get exactly 8 hours of sleep - nothing more or less. Rise at the correct time and go through the motions of the day. Let today be today.

The last week was intense. I stuck to this schedule with due diligence and I'm happy with the progress I have made. One thing I would avoid though is having coffee at 4pm as a pre-workout - it had a marginal effect at the gym and I really couldn't sleep the following night. I ended up resting for 13 hours on Sunday which I believe was a combination of working the brain and body nearing full capacity during the week days. I should be able to keep this pace up, but I'm not looking to work harder than this till I reach an equilibrium of comfort.

Cool, last week was fun. The only thing that's bothering me now is how all the quoted bullet points above are showing '1.' instead of their respective numbers of 1, 2, 3 and 4. I'll need to consult the syntax, quick searches are not looking promising...
