This post looks familiar doesn't it? No it isn't a mirage. This post exists for good reason. There's something about growth that's cyclical. In order for plants to grow there must be night and day so they can respire and photosynthesise accordingly. For muscles to be built we must eat and exercise then rest and digest. When blood flows around the body, the heart must first relax for blood to enter its chambers, before contraction can send blood to the correct areas. It would seem that sustained biological systems all have negative feedback loops to keep order but still allow for industry.

As Benjamin Franklin put it, to be industrious is to "Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary action." It was interesting to hear from Jim Rohn that most animals don't have a choice in the matter - every waking action is purposed for fitness and survival. How much they get done is fascinating! It's said that given enough time, an ant can move an entire mountain, however what wasn't credited was how industrious this ant ought to have been! Alot of things we take for granted an animal never does.

So it is with this second iteration of Project Start which I can continue building on my previous actions.

1. Read for 1 hour a day. Spread this out over two 30 minute sessions uninterrupted. Current readings: Finance and Macroeconomics (Hard) and Rework by Jason Fried & David Heinmeier Hansson (Easy and Fun). Apply what you have learned:
  - See a financial advisor to get investments up and running.
  - Finish the books fast so you can form better conclusions.
2. Write essays. Keep reading John Warriner's English Composition And Grammar, finishing the chapter on Persuasive Writing and starting Expositional Writing. That One Punch Man Essay is coming soon!
3. Finish Painting the Biology tutor sign and post it up. Woohoo, sawing and hammering. Anyone need tuition?
4. Get coding!
  - HTML and CSS crash course tomorrow.
  - Smash an Emacs config file out - install ALL the bells and whistles.
  - Get up to speed on Cody Loyd's Javascript lessons.
5. Maintain Order: "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time." Set up a schedule for rest, exercise and industry. Let's get cracking with org-mode scheduling.

Elon Musk once said: "If you need inspiring words you should not do it."

I refute with: "Do not go gentle into that good night."

And acquiesce with: "Never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool."
