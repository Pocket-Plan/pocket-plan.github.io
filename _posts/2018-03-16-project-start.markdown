Wow, I would have tried starting this project back in December 2017? (@ exactly 2017-12-11 19:46:46 +1300) Yikes. Time flies when you don't have a plan, so let's make one:

1. Read for 1 hour a day. Spread this out over two 30 minute sessions uninterrupted. Current readings: Finance and Macroeconomics.
2. Write essays. Joel Spolsky recommends people to undergo a writing bootcamp that stimulates people to write a 4-5 page essay every week for 10 weeks. 2000 words a week? In this context, sticks and stones may hurt me, but words and strings don't. Common advice is to write what you know about, and, by that inference something you find interesting. This week's topic: One Punch Man.
3. Paint that damn sign. More on this later.
4. Maintain Order: "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time." Turn off all electronic devices one hour before sleeping to get exactly 8 hours of sleep - nothing more or less. Rise at the correct time and go through the motions of the day. Let today be today.

**The Reader:** Hey what's all this boring content below?

**Me:** I'm working on it. Familiarising yourself with technologies involving string technologies takes some time. There's a few cool syntax structures you won't see on the actual website that takes place in the background. Like hyperlinking with variable names. In other words, ignore anything below here.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
